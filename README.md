# Laser-X-Hacks
A hack of the Laser X, laser tag system. My kids have a Laser X laser tag system that uses infrared signals to shoot each other and remove 'lives'. A quick play with an Arduino and some IR receivers and LEDs and I discovered the codes are very, very basic, so I've whipped up this landmine device. The unit is shot by the player which is then armed (displaying the arming teams colour on the RGB led). A timer starts and then the unit smashes out 5 shots through high power IR LEDs, decimating the enemy. The system then resets waiting to be rearmed. 

This is only the first of many ideas for this game system; I need to build a nerf add-on unit and a rapid-fire unit to 'lay suppressing fire'.
